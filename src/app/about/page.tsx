        The Bhagavad Gita is a sacred text from the Indian epic Mahabharata,
        known for its deep spiritual and philosophical insights. It tells the
        story of a conversation between Prince Arjuna and his charioteer, Lord
        Krishna, on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

          Facing a moral crisis about fighting in the war, Arjuna turns to
          Krishna for guidance. Krishna shares profound teachings on duty
          (dharma), action (karma), and the different paths to spiritual growth
          (yoga). He explains the nature of the soul, the importance of living a
          righteous life, and the power of devotion (bhakti).

        The Gita offers timeless wisdom on how to navigate life's challenges
        with clarity and purpose. It inspires people to live with integrity,
        perform their duties selflessly, and seek a deeper connection with the
        divine. Even today, the Bhagavad Gita continues to guide and uplift
        those seeking spiritual understanding and inner peace.
